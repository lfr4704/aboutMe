     <h1>Hello world, this is my website!</h1>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-robles-pe/">Luis Robles,</a> and I am a mechanical engineer transitioning my career path into becoming a full-stack web developer. I'm very interested and passionate about computer software development because this field has a tremendous influence to make people's lives and the world better.  I'm currently bulding on my skills by attending a four month computer programming bootcamp to be completed in June 2018. I'm also taking various online courses in the matter through linkedIn learing. To further develop my skills, I'm currently working on real life projects; one of them is for TL Stop the Violence Coalition based in San Francisco; the second one is to develop a online retail webpage.<br><br> Before this I was a consultant, professional engineer, in the HVAC industry. Thus, I have many transferable skills that are very valuable in any industry including; project management, research and development, excellent communication skills and the application of engineering principles and ethics.<br><br>I am looking for roles in small or medium sized companies where they are looking to develop future company leaders. I'm interested in VR, AR, AI, energy and sustanability, biomedical and travel and tourism industries.<br><br>I'm particularly good in creating solutions in unconventional ways. I like to explore all the resources that are available and making new connections between existing ideas</p>
